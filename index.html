          <p>I have worked on websites for the last 5 years. I have mainly worked on the development end and had the opportunity to work with many highly skilled Graphic Designers. Working directly with a graphic designer  has allowed me to help bring highly functional and beautiful websites to life. </p>
          <p>When I develop  websites I like to begin with a focus on Mobile devices (phones and tablets). I have been working with Zurb Foundation and Twitter Bootstrap to create that device responsive experience. I have mainly worked with HTML, CSS, JQuery and Javascript languages but have worked with SQL and Linux server environments to create websites. I have also worked in a few CMS systems, mainly Accrisoft Freedom, Wordpress and Hubspot.</p>
          <p><b>Skills and Tools:</b> Wireframes, Adobe PhotoShop, Adobe Illustrator, CMS platforms, HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>

          <p>Along with Web development I have also developed some mass email campaigns. Starting with a good design I have been able to create HTML emails that are ready to be seen on a variety of devices.  When working with HTML emails one of my largest focuses is testing, the variety of email clients and rendering engines causes a lot of issues for HTML emails. Testing with tools like Litmus.com allows you to test to see how emails will display in a many browsers to provide users an uniform email. Using those tools I have been able to learn the tricks necessary to set an email to look uniform across all platforms</p>
          <p>Another thing that I keep in mind is many of the rules and regulations of email. Laws like the CAN-SPAM act have rules that require information to be present in messages and campaigns and those need to be taken into account when setting up email messages. Along with those rules each email provider has rules that may cause email messages to be lost in their spam filters, knowing these rules will also help get your messages to your intended recipients.</p>
          <p><b>Skills and Tools:</b> Testing Tools like Litmus, MailChimp, Constant Contact, HTML and CSS</p>

          <p>I have been given the opportunity to manage projects in my various positions and the experience that I have gained here has given me a great outlook on work processes and how to work towards a great result. I have experience with various industry tools like Basecamp, Harvest, Zendesk and Google apps to help manage projects. When managing a project I take a look at the the team that has been tasked to perform the project that has been requested and place those members in a position to use their strengths. At the same time identifying opportunities to allow a team member to do a task that  they may not regularly do and allowing them to rise to the challenge. Aside from just management if I am put in charge of a task I will work alongside the team that I have been tasked with leading.</p>

          <p>Besides just development I have have been tasked with taking on  some of the graphic work necessary on various projects. I have experience with Adobe’s suite of tools, InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop mostly, the Microsoft Office suite and various other programs to create supporting graphics. Many times I  have been tasked to create graphics and adhere to a brand standard, this is something I am very comfortable with. I have worked with creating graphics and full projects in both Print and Web applications, so I am comfortable in both workflows. In past projects I have worked with templates, using existing graphics and from time to time started from scratch. </p>

          <p>Over my past few job I have had the ability to create many amazing things, but then handing them to the eventual end users comes with many potential issues. Training is very important when working with CMS and email platforms that allow input from users with a spectrum of technical experience to edit and modify the content . When I conduct a training with users most of my lessons come from experience with the product that I am presenting. In this case knowing it 100% of the battle, spending time in the product that you are presenting is of the most important things you can do. Training an end user also opens up a dialog for them to give valuable feedback on how to make your products more user friendly.  </p>

          <p>This is a bit harder to explain but I will try my best. One of the major throughlines in a all of the jobs that I have had is crafting solutions. Larger than creating manuals, setting up brochures and coding websites, my work has largely been at the service of one goal, a solution. Every project starts with a problem and although finding that problem may be hard that is at the core of every decision that one must make over the course of a project. Having worked with the industries that I have , from shoestring University departments to large corporate Health Systems, each has shown me that every problem has multiple solutions, the avenues that one will take to solve a problem is what changes your approach. Spending time thinking about the solutions is integral to all of the work that I ever do. So I take this idea into everything that I do. </p>

          <h6>Hello I&#39;m Dan Mattina.</h6>
          <div class="row">
          <div class="large-9 medium-9 columns">
          <p> I am originally from the metro Detroit Area and went to college at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. After graduation I moved to Perrysburg, Ohio. </p>
          <p>I was fortunate to be a child of the Internet age. For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated by the intranet and how it works. The internet is a tool that allows everyone to have a voice and be a part of.  I’ve been tinkering with and making some the internet for much of the last 15 years of my life.  I love all the has been done on the Internet and am always ready to try a new app or service. </p>
          <p>To completely contradict that last point I have also found myself with a passion for the outdoors. During my time in college I was lucky to stumble into the BGSU Outdoor Program early and it grabbed me. I have seen many of the backroads of this country in search of adventure. I am a (infrequent at best) Runner, Backpacker, Mountain Biker and Former (hopefully once again) Rock Climber.</p>
